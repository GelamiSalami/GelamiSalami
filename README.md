### Hallo! ðŸ‘‹ I'm GelamiSalami!
I do shaders and rendering and everything graphics programming. I am very interested in topics such as raytracing, raymarching/sphere tracing, SDFs, voxels, ray-traversal algorithms, tilings and tesselations, iridescent materials, just to name a few.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently writing about raytracing intersection functions at [my blog](https://gelamisalami.github.io/blog/) and creating WebGL toys, some of which I share here.

ðŸ“« You can reach out to me on my Twitter [@GelamiSalami](https://twitter.com/GelamiSalami) or through Gmail at **gelami.salami**.
