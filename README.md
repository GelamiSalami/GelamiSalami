### Hallo! 👋 I'm GelamiSalami!
I do shaders and rendering and everything graphics programming. I am very interested in topics such as raytracing, raymarching/sphere tracing, SDFs, voxels, ray-traversal algorithms, tilings and tesselations, iridescent materials, just to name a few.

🔭 I’m currently exploring falling sand simulations in compute shaders and writing about intersection functions in raytracing at [my blog](https://gelamisalami.github.io/blog/).
