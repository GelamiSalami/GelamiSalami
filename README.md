### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm GelamiSalami!
I'm a technical artist specialized in shaders and rendering. I am passionate about graphics programming in topics such as raytracing, raymarching/sphere tracing, SDFs, voxels, ray-traversal algorithms, spectral rendering, and iridescent materials, to name a few.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring techniques on terrain rendering with quadtree displacement mapping and voxel rendering.
